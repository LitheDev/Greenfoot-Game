        N Y - Assignment 2
        ===========
        
        Story: 
        The time crunch is becoming... crunchier. Assignment is coming due and no study has been done. 3 weeks for an assignment deadline seemed like such a long time, enough time to re-watch all of the cutscenes in Metal Gear Solid 4, Ninja dash around the house to their favorite anime soundtrack, amongst other activities befitting
        a contributing member of society. The time flew by at the blink of an eye. On the dawn of the last day the Unnamed University Student realized they had to slow time down but could not because they were not an anime character despite really
        wanting to be. The student realized the problem was fun, fun made time go fast, they now had to alter their perception and become bored to slow time down. They must collect the boring socks in their room and avoid fun at all costs.
        
        Description:
