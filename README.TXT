A game created July 2022 for my Programming Assignment. 

In this game you play a student who is trying to get her assignments done on time, but after binging Netflix and playing video games our protagonist finds that time has flew by and their assignment is due tomorrow. In order to buy herself more time, our protagonist must become bored and clean up her room to slow down time. As you collect more socks, the embodiment of fun (a snowman full of consoles) will attempt to distract you, don't get caught by them. Collect socks up until the goal mentioned to win!
